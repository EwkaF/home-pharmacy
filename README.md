## Home Pharmacy

in progress...

It's  going to be an application that will help you manage your drug database at home: create a list of your medicines that you have at home.Every time you are in a pharmacy to buy medicines, eg after a visit to a doctor, check whether this medicine is no longer in your home pharmacy.
Using the created list you can control the expiration date of your medicines. You can add descriptions to your medicines, for example the dosage. Or you can search your home pharmacy by categories...

This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
